# Define a dictionary of custom actions with their corresponding command strings
# Each action is a key-value pair where the key is the action name (in title case) and the value is its corresponding command string

# For example, the first action is "Pause" with the command string "/pause"
actions = {
    "Pause": "/pause",  # Action name: Pause, Command string: /pause

    # The second action is "Resume" with the command string "/resume"
    "Resume": "/resume",  # Action name: Resume, Command string: /resume
}
