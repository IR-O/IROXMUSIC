# Define a list of custom actions with their corresponding command strings
# Each action is a tuple containing the action name (in title case) and its corresponding command string

# For example, the first action is "Pause" with the command string "/pause"
actions = [
    ("PᴀᴜSᴇ", "/pause"),  # Action name: Pause, Command string: /pause

    # The second action is "Resume" with the command string "/resume"
    ("Rᴇsᴜᴍᴇ", "/resume"),  # Action name: Resume, Command string: /resume
]
